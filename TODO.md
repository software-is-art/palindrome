# Palindrome VM - TODO

## Current Status
✅ Core VM implementation complete with reversible execution
✅ Basic tape system with history and checkpoint/rewind
✅ Assembly language parser and runner
✅ Example programs demonstrating reversibility

## Completed Features
- [x] Core tape with 4KB pages and COW
- [x] Reversible instruction set (arithmetic, memory, control flow)
- [x] Assembly parser with label support
- [x] Interactive debugger with time-travel
- [x] Basic segment management
- [x] Checkpoint/rewind functionality
- [x] Stack operations
- [x] Tape marks and seeking

## High Priority - Core Improvements

### 1. Tape Persistence ✅ (Implemented via SDM)
- [x] Save tape state to disk (SDM FileBackend)
- [x] Load tape from disk (SDM automatic page loading)
- [x] Incremental history snapshots (SDM page versioning)
- [x] Compressed history storage (SDM compression policy)

#### SDM Enhancements TODO:
- [ ] Implement S3Backend for cold storage
- [ ] Add async prefetching for better performance
- [ ] Implement network storage backend
- [ ] Add configurable storage policies via config file

### 2. Type System Extensions
- [ ] String support (not just i64)
- [ ] Arrays/vectors
- [ ] Structs/records
- [ ] Type safety in assembly

### 3. High-Level Language
- [ ] Design Palindrome language syntax
- [ ] Parser for high-level language
- [ ] Compiler to VM assembly
- [ ] Standard library with reversible operations

## Medium Priority - Practical Features

### 4. Real Applications
- [ ] Reversible text editor demo
- [ ] Reversible calculator with full history
- [ ] Game with rewind mechanics
- [ ] Collaborative editing with time-travel

### 5. Developer Experience
- [ ] Binary instruction format
- [ ] Bytecode optimizer
- [ ] Source-level debugger
- [ ] VS Code extension for .pvm files

### 6. Library Ecosystem
- [ ] Rust embedding API
- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] JavaScript/WASM version
- [ ] C API for embedding

## Low Priority - Advanced Features

### 7. Reversible OS Components
- [ ] Filesystem on tape segments
- [ ] Process management with checkpoints
- [ ] Reversible shell
- [ ] Package manager with rollback

### 8. Distributed Features (Maybe Skip?)
- [ ] Tape replication protocol
- [ ] Distributed consensus on rewinds
- [ ] Network message reversibility
- [ ] Multi-node tape synchronization

## Philosophical Questions to Explore

1. **Reversible I/O**: How to handle external world interactions?
   - Buffered I/O with commit/rollback?
   - Reversible network protocol?
   - Undo logs for external effects?

2. **Performance**: Where to optimize?
   - JIT compilation for hot paths?
   - History compression algorithms?
   - Selective history (only track modified values)?

3. **Integration**: How to bridge reversible/traditional systems?
   - FFI with automatic checkpointing?
   - Reversible wrappers for system calls?
   - Transaction boundaries for external calls?

## Next Steps (Recommended Path)

1. **Week 1**: Add tape persistence - make it real
2. **Week 2**: Design high-level language syntax
3. **Week 3**: Build reversible text editor demo
4. **Week 4**: Create Rust embedding API
5. **Week 5**: Implement string/array types
6. **Week 6**: Ship v0.1 with practical examples

## What We're NOT Doing (For Now)

- ❌ Full SQL engine (use embedded approach)
- ❌ Distributed consensus (too complex)
- ❌ Production-grade performance (prototype first)
- ❌ Compatibility with existing systems (pure reversible)
- ❌ Security/permissions (single-user first)

## Vision Checkpoint

The goal is to demonstrate that a **fully reversible software stack** is not just possible but *preferable* for many applications. We're building a foundation for software where:

- Bugs can be traced by reversing to their origin
- Users never lose work
- Developers can experiment fearlessly  
- The phrase "are you sure?" becomes obsolete

Every decision should move us toward this vision of **fearless, reversible computing**.
