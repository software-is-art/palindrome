# Palindrome VM - TODO

## Current Status
✅ Core VM implementation complete with RISA + SDM
✅ Reversible Instruction Set Architecture (RISA) implemented
✅ Software Defined Memory (SDM) with IC-based versioning
✅ Zero-overhead reversibility achieved!

## Recently Completed (2025-08-09)
- [x] Implemented RISA instructions (RADD, RSUB, RXOR, RLOAD, RSTORE, MSWAP, SWAP)
- [x] Added Instruction Counter (IC) to VM state
- [x] Integrated IC-based versioning in SDM page table
- [x] Removed trail-based execution entirely
- [x] Updated all tests and examples to use RISA
- [x] Updated documentation (README, DESIGN, RISA, SDM)

## Research Questions

### Theoretical
1. Can we prove that all RISA programs terminate?
2. What's the minimal set of reversible operations?
3. How to handle quantum-inspired superposition?
4. Can we formalize the relationship between IC and causality?

### Practical
1. How to make I/O reversible without infinite buffers?
2. What's the optimal page size for SDM?
3. How to handle time-travel in distributed systems?
4. Can we make networking protocols reversible?

## What We're NOT Doing (For Now)
- ❌ Compatibility with x86/ARM
- ❌ POSIX compliance
- ❌ Traditional debugging tools
- ❌ Non-reversible optimizations

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- All operations provably reversible
- Zero memory leaks by design
- Sub-microsecond instruction execution
- Constant-time reversal

### User Experience
- No data loss ever
- Intuitive time-travel debugging
- Fear-free experimentation
- "Undo anything" guarantee

## Vision

We're building the foundation for a new kind of computing where:
- Every action can be undone
- Every bug can be traced to its origin
- Every experiment is safe
- Every user is empowered

The future of computing is reversible.
