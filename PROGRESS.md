## Key Decisions

1. **Tape Structure**: Using BTreeMap for pages with 4KB page size for cache efficiency
2. **History Model**: Trail-based with operation records for efficient reversal
3. **Segment Design**: Named regions with type information for structured data
4. **Instruction Set**: Minimal but complete, with paired forward/reverse operations

## Performance Metrics

Target benchmarks:
- Instruction throughput: 1M+ ops/sec
- Memory overhead: ~2x with history
- Checkpoint/rewind: O(n) operations
- Page access: O(log n) with BTree

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for full programs
3. Property-based testing for reversibility invariants
4. Benchmarks for performance validation

## Notes

- Prioritizing correctness over performance initially
- Focusing on single-threaded implementation first
- Distributed features will come after core is solid

## What's Next?

See TODO.md for the detailed roadmap. Key priorities:

1. **Tape Persistence**: Save/load VM state to disk
2. **High-Level Language**: Design Palindrome syntax with time-travel as first-class
3. **Real Demo Apps**: Reversible text editor, calculator, games
4. **Better Types**: Strings, arrays, structs (not just i64)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reversibility is surprisingly easy** when built in from the start
2. **The tape abstraction works** - unifying memory/storage/history is powerful
3. **Interactive debugging with rewind** is a killer feature
4. **Performance is acceptable** for the benefits gained

## The Bigger Vision

This VM is just the beginning. Imagine:
- An OS where Ctrl+Z works everywhere
- Databases that can't lose data
- Deployments you can instantly rollback
- Development without fear of breaking things

Every operation reversible. Every state recoverable. Every bug traceable to its origin.

That's the future we're building toward.
