## Key Architecture Decisions

### RISA + SDM Integration
The VM now uses a unified reversible architecture:
- **No trail needed**: RISA instructions are mathematically reversible
- **Automatic versioning**: SDM tags each memory write with IC
- **Deterministic reversal**: IC tracking ensures correct memory versions
- **Zero overhead**: No history recording, just smart data structures

### Implementation Details
1. **Instruction Counter**: Global counter incremented on each instruction
2. **Page Versioning**: Each page write includes `written_at_ic`
3. **Reverse Execution**: Instructions run backwards, SDM provides historical versions
4. **Memory Model**: 4KB pages with COW and BTree storage

## TODO - High Priority

### SDM Enhancements
- [ ] Implement S3Backend for cold storage
- [ ] Add async prefetching for better performance
- [ ] Implement network storage backend
- [ ] Add configurable storage policies via TOML
- [ ] Implement compression for cold pages

### Type System Extensions
- [ ] String support (not just i64)
- [ ] Arrays/vectors
- [ ] Structs/records
- [ ] Type safety in assembly

### High-Level Language
- [ ] Design Palindrome language syntax
- [ ] Parser for high-level language
- [ ] Compiler to VM assembly
- [ ] Standard library with reversible operations

## TODO - Medium Priority

### Real Applications
- [ ] Reversible text editor demo
- [ ] Reversible calculator with full history
- [ ] Game with rewind mechanics
- [ ] Collaborative editing with time-travel

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Binary instruction format
- [ ] Bytecode optimizer
- [ ] Source-level debugger
- [ ] VS Code extension for .pvm files

### Library Ecosystem
- [ ] Rust embedding API
- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] JavaScript/WASM version
- [ ] C API for embedding

## TODO - Low Priority

### Reversible OS Components
- [ ] Filesystem on tape segments
- [ ] Process management with checkpoints
- [ ] Reversible shell
- [ ] Package manager with rollback

### Advanced Features
- [ ] JIT compilation for hot paths
- [ ] Advanced compression algorithms
- [ ] Distributed tape protocol
- [ ] Multi-node synchronization

## Performance Metrics

Current performance characteristics:
- Instruction throughput: ~1M ops/sec (estimated)
- Memory overhead: Minimal with RISA (no trail)
- Page access: O(log n) with BTree
- Reversal cost: O(1) per instruction

## Next Steps (Recommended Path)

1. **Week 1**: SDM enhancements (S3, async prefetch)
2. **Week 2**: Type system extensions (strings, arrays)
3. **Week 3**: High-level language design
4. **Week 4**: Reversible text editor demo
5. **Week 5**: Rust embedding API
6. **Week 6**: Ship v0.1 with practical examples

## Philosophical Questions Being Explored

1. **Reversible I/O**: How to handle external world interactions?
2. **Performance vs Purity**: Where to optimize without breaking reversibility?
3. **Integration**: How to bridge reversible/traditional systems?

## Vision

Building a foundation for software where:
- Bugs can be traced by reversing to their origin
- Users never lose work
- Developers can experiment fearlessly
- The phrase "are you sure?" becomes obsolete

Every operation reversible. Every state recoverable. Every bug traceable to its origin.

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-09)

Today we achieved a major milestone by unifying RISA + SDM:
- Removed all trail-based execution code
- Implemented IC-based memory versioning
- Updated all instructions to RISA format
- Fixed all tests to work with new architecture
- Updated documentation to reflect unified model

The VM is now simpler, more elegant, and more performant with true zero-overhead reversibility!
